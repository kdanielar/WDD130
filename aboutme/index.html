    <h2>Karol Daniela</h2>
    <p>I'm from Colombia, Bogota. I'm studying software Engineering! I love dancing,
        doing excercise, expending time with my family and cooking.
        Currently I'm working in Melaleuca, with customer service.
        This is my first class web development related and I want to master the basics of HTML.
        In the future I want to develop my own website to have my customers schedule appointments to attend my spa. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the church since I was 8 years old.
        I am grateful for the parents I had because they taught me the gospel.
        I love the book of Mormon and I had the blessing to serve s mission.
        I am who I am because of the angels, family and friends Heavenly Father have placed on my path. </p>
