When cleansing your face, be sure to use a gentle cleanser that would not irritate your skin or strip away the tint. Avoid using products that contain exfoliating ingredients, such as alpha-hydroxy acids, for the first few days after your treatment. Apply Sunscreen to o protect your skin and keep your brow tint looking its best. Look for a broad-spectrum formula with an SPF of 30 or higher. Avoid Using Oil-Based Products, such as makeup removers or heavy creams, can cause the tint to fade or run.
