    <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
    <p>The range of the rapids is from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
        undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
        and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. 
        There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend 
        to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more..</p>

    <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
    <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
        the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
        beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
        This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
        and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and 
        historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.

        Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>

    <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
    <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make 
        one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater 
        rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.

        CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically 
        rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, 
        most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both..</p>
